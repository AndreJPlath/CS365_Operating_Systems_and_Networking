Course Objectives:
This course provides an introduction to Operating Systems as managers of sys- tems resources and networking fundamentals. Management of tasks, memory, and peripheral devices is explored. Topics include task synchronization, mes- sage handling, scheduling, dispatching, network communications and protocols. Students gain hands-on experiences via labs and projects.
Prerequisite: CS 260 and CS271.

Outcomes:
Upon completion of the course, students will be able to:
• Explain the objectives and functions of modern operating systems.
• Describe the functions of a contemporary operating system with respect to convenience, efficiency, and the ability to evolve.
• Discuss networked, client-server, distributed operating systems and how they differ from single user operating systems.

General Information:
All handouts and important information will be posted or notified.

We will mainly cover the topics listed above. And we will try to cover some other topics if time permits and there are enough students who are interested.

Grading:
There will be homework (or labs), one presentation, one on-class midterm, and one on-class final exam. They will count toward the grade as follows:
Homework (or labs)(40%), Presentation (10%), Midterm Exam (20%), Final Exam (30%).

FinalGrade:
100%-92% A 89%-88% B+ 79%-78% C+ 69%-68% D+ 59%-0% F

If we find similar solutions, it will be treated as cheating! You get zero on the cheated assignment if you are caught once in any form of the cheating. In addition, the violation will also be reported to the division and the university.
